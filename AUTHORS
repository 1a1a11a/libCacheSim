The CMimircache project benefits from the efforts of a number of people:

  * Juncheng Yang (Emory University) designed and wrote most of the framework,
  * Ymir Vigfusson (Emory University/Reykjavik University) is the faculty
    sponsor of the project, 

The PARDA design is credited to Qingpeng Niu et al. Citation: PARDA: A Fast Parallel Reuse Distance Analysis Algorithm. Qingpeng Niu, James Dinan, Qingda Lu and P.  Sadayappan.  IEEE IPDPS (IPDPS'12), May 2012, Shanghai, China.

Now CMimircache is part of PyMimircache, which provides an easier interface to use, any change to CMimircache also needs change to the PyMimircache package to guarantee consistent results.
