Separation of PyMimircache and libMimircache, now libMimircache is an independent module, which can be used directly, this has the following benefits:
1. allows people who only want C/C++ mimircache module to use libMimircache.
2. the debug of libMimircache becomes easier.
3. simplifies the dependency on libMimircache from other components.
