Separation of PyMimircache and CMimircache, now CMimircache is an independent module, which can be used directly, this has the following benefits: 
1. allows people who only want C/C++ mimircache module to use CMimircache. 
2. the debug of CMimircache becomes easier. 
3. simplifies the dependency on CMimircache from other components.
