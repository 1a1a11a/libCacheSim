## What is libCacheSim
* a high-performance cache simulator binary for running cache simulations. 
* a high-performance library for building cache simulators. 

---

## libCacheSim features 
* [**high performance**](performance.md) - over 20M requests/sec for a realistic trace replay. 
* [**high memory efficiency**](performance.md) - predictable and small memory footprint ~36 bytes memory per cached object. 
* [**performance and memory mode**](performance.md) - run the simulator in performance mode with larger memory footprint, or run it in slower low-memory mode.  
* **State-of-the-art algorithms** - eviction algorithms, admission algorithms, sampling techniques, approximate miss ratio computation. 
* **Simple API** - easy to build cache clusters, multi-layer caching, etc.
* **extensible** - easy to add traceReader or eviction algorithms either in source or load using plugin systems.    
* **Realistic simulator** - support object size, wall clock time, operations, etc. 
* **wide trace formats support** - support txt, csv/tsv, binary, vscsi trace formats.

## Build and Install 
libCacheSim uses [camke](https://cmake.org/) build system and has two dependencies: 
[GNOME glib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/) and [Google tcmalloc](https://github.com/google/tcmalloc).

### Install dependency
Mac (using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as an example)
```
brew install glib google-perftools
```

Linux (using Ubuntu as an example)
```
sudo apt install libglib2.0-dev libgoogle-perftools-dev
```

[Optional] Install XGBoost (Linux):
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost
pushd xgboost;
mkdir build && cd build;
cmake .. && make -j; 
sudo make install; 
popd
```

### Build libCacheSim
cmake recommends **out-of-source build**, so we do it in a new directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/1a1a11a/libCacheSim 
pushd libCachesim;
mkdir _build && cd _build;
cmake .. && make -j;
sudo make install;
popd;
```


## Usage
### Quickstart (cachesim binary)


More usages in [quick start cachesim](quickstart_cachesim.md) for a tutorial. 




### Quickstart (libCacheSim library)



#### Linking with libCacheSim
linking can be done in cmake or use pkg-config  
Such as at the _build directory:  
```
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PWD
```
#### Performance Optimizations 
* hugepage - to turn on hugepage support, please do `echo madvise | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled`

### Quickstart  
See [example folder](example) for more examples on how to use libCacheSim, such as cache cluster with consistent hashing, multi-layer caching simulators. 
Here is a simplified example showing the most basic APIs. 
```c 
#include <libCacheSim.h>

/* open trace, see quickstart.md for opening csv and binary trace */
reader_t *reader = open_trace("data/trace.vscsi", VSCSI_TRACE, OBJ_ID_NUM, NULL);

/* craete a container for reading from trace */
request_t *req = new_request();

/* create a LRU cache */
common_cache_params_t cc_params = {.cache_size=1024*1024U}; 
cache_t *cache = create_cache("LRU", cc_params, NULL); 

/* counters */
uint64_t req_byte = 0, miss_byte = 0;

/* loop through the trace */
while (read_one_req(reader, req) == 0) {
    if (cache->get(cache, req) == cache_ck_miss) {
        miss_byte += req->obj_size;
    }
    req_byte += req->obj_size; 
}

/* cleaning */
close_trace(reader);
free_request(req);
cache->cache_free(cache);


```
save this to `test.c` and compile with 
```
g++ $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libCacheSim glib-2.0) -IlibCacheSim/include -lm -ldl test.c -o test.out
```

if you get `error while loading shared libraries`, run `sudo ldconfig`
