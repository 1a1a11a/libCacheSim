## Build and Install libCacheSim
<!-- TOC --><a name="one-line-install"></a>
### One-line install
We provide some scripts for quick installation of libCacheSim. 
```bash
cd scripts && bash install_dependency.sh && bash install_libcachesim.sh
```
If this does not work, please 
1. let us know what system you are using and what error you get
2. read the following sections for self-installation.

<!-- TOC --><a name="install-dependency"></a>
### Install dependency
libCacheSim uses [cmake](https://cmake.org/) build system and has a few dependencies: [glib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/), [tcmalloc](https://github.com/google/tcmalloc), [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd).
Please see [install.md](/doc/install.md) for instructions on how to install the dependencies. 


<!-- TOC --><a name="build-libcachesim"></a>
### Build libCacheSim
cmake recommends **out-of-source build**, so we do it in a new directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/1a1a11a/libCacheSim
pushd libCacheSim
mkdir _build && cd _build
cmake .. && make -j
[sudo] make install
popd
```

## Usage
<!-- TOC --><a name="cachesim-a-high-performance-cache-simulator"></a>
### cachesim (a high-performance cache simulator)
After building and installing libCacheSim, `cachesim` should be in the `_build/bin/` directory. 
<!-- TOC --><a name="basic-usage"></a>
#### basic usage
```
./bin/cachesim trace_path trace_type eviction_algo cache_size [OPTION...]
```

use `./bin/cachesim --help` to get more information.

<!-- TOC --><a name="run-a-single-cache-simulation"></a>
#### Run a single cache simulation
Run the example traces with LRU eviction algorithm and 1GB cache size. 

```bash
# Note that no space between the cache size and the unit, and the unit is not case-sensitive
./bin/cachesim ../data/trace.vscsi vscsi lru 1gb 
```

<!-- TOC --><a name="run-multiple-cache-simulations-with-different-cache-sizes"></a>
#### Run multiple cache simulations with different cache sizes
```bash
# Note that there is no space between the cache sizes
./bin/cachesim ../data/trace.vscsi vscsi lru 1mb,16mb,256mb,8gb

# Besides absolute cache size, you can also use a fraction of the working set size
./bin/cachesim ../data/trace.vscsi vscsi lru 0.001,0.01,0.1,0.2

# besides using byte as the unit, you can also treat all objects having the same size, and the size is the number of objects
./bin/cachesim ../data/trace.vscsi vscsi lru 1000,16000 --ignore-obj-size 1

# use a csv trace, note the quotation marks when you have multiple options
./bin/cachesim ../data/trace.csv csv lru 1gb -t "time-col=2, obj-id-col=5, obj-size-col=4"

# use a csv trace with more options
./bin/cachesim ../data/trace.csv csv lru 1gb -t "time-col=2, obj-id-col=5, obj-size-col=4, delimiter=,, has-header=true"
``` 

See [quick start cachesim](/doc/quickstart_cachesim.md) for more usages. 


<!-- TOC --><a name="plot-miss-ratio-curve"></a>
#### Plot miss ratio curve
You can plot miss ratios of different algorithms and sizes, and plot the miss ratios over time.

```bash
# plot miss ratio over size
cd scripts
python3 plot_mrc_size.py --tracepath ../data/twitter_cluster52.csv --trace-format csv --trace-format-params="time-col=1,obj-id-col=2,obj-size-col=3,delimiter=," --algos=fifo,lru,lecar,s3fifo --sizes=0.001,0.002,0.005,0.01,0.02,0.05,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4

# plot miss ratio over time
python3 plot_mrc_time.py --tracepath ../data/twitter_cluster52.csv --trace-format csv --trace-format-params="time-col=1, obj-id-col=2, obj-size-col=3, delimiter=,," --algos=fifo,lru,lecar,s3fifo --report-interval=30 --miss-ratio-type="accu"
```

<!-- TOC --><a name="trace-analysis"></a>
### Trace analysis
libCacheSim also has a trace analyzer that provides a lot of useful information about the trace. 
And it is very fast, designed to work with billions of requests. 
It also comes with a set of scripts to help you analyze the trace. 
See [trace analysis](/doc/quickstart_traceAnalyzer.md) for more details.




---

<!-- TOC --><a name="using-libcachesim-as-a-library"></a>
### Using libCacheSim as a library 
libCacheSim can be used as a library for building cache simulators. 
For example, you can build a cache cluster with consistent hashing or a multi-layer cache simulator.

Here is a simplified example showing the basic APIs. 
```c 
#include <libCacheSim.h>

/* open trace, see quickstart_lib.md for opening csv and binary trace */
reader_t *reader = open_trace("../data/trace.vscsi", VSCSI_TRACE, NULL);

/* create a container for reading from trace */
request_t *req = new_request();

/* create a LRU cache */
common_cache_params_t cc_params = {.cache_size=1024*1024U}; 
cache_t *cache = LRU_init(cc_params, NULL); 

/* counters */
uint64_t n_req = 0, n_miss = 0;

/* loop through the trace */
while (read_one_req(reader, req) == 0) {
    if (!cache->get(cache, req)) {
        n_miss++;
    }
    n_req++;
}

printf("miss ratio: %.4lf\n", (double)n_miss / n_req);

/* cleaning */
close_trace(reader);
free_request(req);
cache->cache_free(cache);
```

save this to `test.c` and compile it with below command. For `libCacheSim.h` to work correctly we need the following libs to be installed first: [glib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/) and [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd). Please check the previous section [installation](#install-dependency).
```bash
gcc test.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libCacheSim glib-2.0) -o test.out -lm -lzstd
```
To run the executable,
```bash
./test.out
```

See [here](/doc/advanced_lib.md) for more details, and see [example folder](/example) for examples on how to use libCacheSim, such as building a cache cluster with consistent hashing, multi-layer cache simulators.

<!-- TOC --><a name="extending-libcachesim-new-algorithms-and-trace-types"></a>
### Extending libCacheSim (new algorithms and trace types)
libCacheSim supports *txt*, *csv*, and *binary* traces. We prefer binary traces because it allows libCacheSim to run faster, and the traces are more compact. 

We also support zstd compressed binary traces without decompression. This allows you to store the traces with less space.

If you need to add a new trace type or a new algorithm, please see [here](/doc/advanced_lib_extend.md) for details.

<!-- TOC --><a name="open-source-cache-traces"></a>
## Open source cache traces
In the [repo](/data/), there are sample (one from cloudphysics and one from twitter) traces in different formats (csv, txt, vscsi, and oracleGeneral). Note that the provided traces are **very small** samples and __should not be used for evaluating different algorithms' miss ratios__. The full traces can be found either with the original release or the processed oracleGeneral format. 

Note that the oracleGeneral traces are compressed with [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) and have the following format:

```
struct {
    uint32_t timestamp;
    uint64_t obj_id;
    uint32_t obj_size;
    int64_t next_access_vtime;  // -1 if no next access
}
```
The compressed traces can be used with libCacheSim without decompression. And libCacheSim provides a `tracePrint` tool to print the trace in human-readable format.

Among the large number of traces, I recommend using the newer traces from Twitter (cluster52), Wiki, and Meta.
