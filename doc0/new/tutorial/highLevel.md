# Tutorial for high-level users 

This tutorial is for users who need to run cache (admission + eviction algorithms) in pre-defined ways. For example, you will learn *how to obtain the miss ratio of a trace running on certain caches* (LRU, FIFO, LHD, Hyperbolic, etc.). 


## Basic concepts 
### Cache 

#### Cache admission
#### Cache eviction 

### Trace 

#### Sampling 

#### Read trace 

find the basic components to build cache simulators
